The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in
history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after
colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This
sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better
safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there
were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was
some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people
were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the
upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people
were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine
learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
