### Santander Customer Satisfaction

__Which customers are happy customers?__

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key
measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more,
unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

[Santander Bank](https://www.santanderbank.com/us/personal) is asking
Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their
relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to
improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to
predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking
experience.
